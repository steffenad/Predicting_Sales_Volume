# Predicting Sales Volume and Profitability
<br>
<br>

The sales team is considering adding some new products to Blackwell's product mix.  

They have shortlisted 17 that fit Blackwellâ€™s business strategy, but now they need help narrowing the list down to five. 

Therefore it is necessary to perform a regression analysis to predict the sales volume of each of the potential new products.

In this analysis, the assumption is that certain attributes are associated with highly successful (current) products and

any potential new products that also have these attributes will be similarly successful, 

regardless if a potential new product is similar to an existing product or not.
